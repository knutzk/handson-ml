# Jupyter notebooks with machine-learning basics

Forked from https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.

This repository is a collection of jupyter notebooks to teach some of the basics of machine learning. They provide easy access to out-of-the-box code examples, and they are meant to give insights into the most basic machine-learning algorithms.

Many of the code examples are taken from or inspired by Ref. [1], a book I can only recommend to study for hands-on examples of machine learning. All code examples of the book are available in the A. Geron's [github repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml). As this repository is a direct forked from A. Geron's repository, it is made available under the same licensing terms using the Apache License 2.0.

The content of the Jupyter Notebooks can be opened directly by just clicking on them in the list of files above. Or use the slightly more comfortable [notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/knutzk/handson-ml/) (which is also faster).
